Unpacks and decodes .esd files from Dark Souls.

These files are quite complex. The comments in the code are hopefully enough for you for now.

This is currently a READER ONLY, and it only works for the /talk/ .esd files. The files in
/menu/ and /chr/ use slightly different formats that I can't handle yet.

Feel free to provide any hypotheses and evidence about the identities of function indices.
